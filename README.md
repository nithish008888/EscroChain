In decentralized payment systems, establishing trust is crucial, especially when the transacting parties are unfamiliar with each other. Escrow protocols like Eskro offer a reliable way to ensure secure transactions without relying on intermediaries.

With Eskro, digital assets are deposited into a smart contract—a self-executing program on the blockchain—that acts as a neutral escrow. This contract holds the funds until both sides fulfill the agreed-upon terms, such as delivering a product or service, ensuring fairness for all parties.

When a transaction depends on real-world data, like verifying shipment, an oracle is used. Oracles provide external information to the smart contract, enabling it to release funds only when the conditions are confirmed.

Once deployed, the smart contract becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered. This guarantees the integrity of the system and protects participants from fraud or manipulation.

Overall, decentralized escrow protocols offer a secure, transparent, and trustless way to carry out blockchain-based exchanges—eliminating the need for centralized control.
