##  Project Overview

In decentralized payment systems, building trust is essential‚Äîespecially when parties are unfamiliar with each other. **EscroChain** addresses this by using blockchain-based smart contracts and oracles to create a secure, intermediary-free escrow mechanism.

* **Smart Contracts**: Assets are deposited into an immutable, self-executing contract on the blockchain. Funds are only released when both parties meet predefined conditions.
* **Oracles**: For real-world event validation (e.g., shipment confirmation), oracles provide external data to the smart contract.
* **Trustless Transactions**: By removing central control, the system ensures fairness, transparency, and resistance to tampering or fraud.
